# What is GGIR?

[GGIR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR) is an R-package to
process multi-day raw accelerometer data for physical activity and sleep
research. The term ***raw*** refers to data being expressed in
m/s<sup>2</sup> or gravitational acceleration as opposed to the previous
generation accelerometers which stored data in accelerometer brand
specific units. The signal processing includes automatic calibration,
detection of sustained abnormally high values, detection of non-wear and
calculation of average magnitude of dynamic acceleration based on a
variety of metrics. Next, GGIR uses this information to describe the
data per recording, per day of measurement, and (optionally) per segment
of a day of measurement, including estimates of physical activity,
inactivity and sleep. We published an overview paper of GGIR in 2019
[link](https://doi.org/10.1123/jmpb.2018-0063).

This vignette provides a general introduction on how to use GGIR and
interpret the output, additionally you can find a [introduction
video](https://youtu.be/RuFBCAqFJ2M) and a
[mini-tutorial](https://youtu.be/S8YPTrYNWdU) on YouTube. If you want to
use your own algorithms for raw data then GGIR facilitates this with
it's external function embedding feature, documented in a separate
vignette: [Embedding external functions in
GGIR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR). GGIR is increasingly
being used by research groups across the world. A non-exhaustive
overview of academic publications related to GGIR can be found
[here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/wiki/Publication-list). R package
GGIR would not have been possible without the support of the
contributors listed in the author list at
[GGIR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR), with specific code
contributions over time since April 2016 (when GGIR development moved to
GitHub) shown
[here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/graphs/contributors).

**Cite GGIR:**

When you use GGIR in publications do not forget to cite it properly as
that makes your research more reproducible and it gives credit to it's
developers. See paragraph on [Citing GGIR](#CitingGGIR) for details.

## Contributing, Support, and Keeping up to date

**How to contribute to the code?**

The development version of GGIR can be found on
[github](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR), which is also where you will
find
[guidance](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
on how to contribute.

**How can I get service and support?**

GGIR is open source software and does not come with service or support
guarantees. However, as user-community you can help each other via the
[GGIR google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/RpackageGGIR) or the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues). Please
use these public platform rather than private e-mails such that other
users can learn from the conversations.

If you need dedicated support with the use of GGIR or need someone to
adapt GGIR to your needs then Vincent van Hees is available as
[independent consultant](https://www.accelting.com/).

**Training in R essentials and GGIR** We offer frequent online GGIR training courses. Check our dedicated training
[website](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-training/) with more details and
the option to book your training. Do you have questions about the
training or the booking process? Do not hesitate to contact us via:
[training\@accelting.com](mailto:training@accelting.com){.email}.

Also of interest may be the brief [free R introduction tutorial](https://www.accelting.com/updates/short-r-tutorial/).


**Change log**

Our log of main changes to GGIR over time can be found
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GGIR/news/news.html).

# Setting up your work environment

## Install R and RStudio

[Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

[Download and install
RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

Install GGIR with its dependencies from CRAN. You can do this with one
command from the console command line:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("GGIR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, to install the latest development version with the latest
bug fixes use instead:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wadpac/GGIR")
```

Additionally, in some use-cases you will need to install one or multiple 
additional packages:

-   If you are working with Axivity, GENEActiv, or GENEA files, install
    the GGIRread package with `install.packages("GGIRread")`
-   If you are working with ActiGraph gt3x files, install
    the read.gt3x package with `install.packages("read.gt3x")`
-   If you want to derive Neishabouricounts (with `do.neishabouricounts = TRUE`),
    install the actilifecounts package with `install.packages("actilifecounts")`
-   If you want to derive circadian rhythm indicators using the [Cosinor analysis and Extended Cosinor analysis] 
    (with `cosinor = TRUE`), install the ActCR package with `install.packages("ActCR")`
