This section will help you understand whether GGIR can assist in analyzing your 
accelerometer data. Additionally, it guides you through the process of 
configuring your work environment to initiate the use of GGIR with your own 
accelerometer data.

## Is GGIR for you?

First, is GGIR for you? GGIR tries to provide support to analyse
accelerometer raw data independently of the monitor brand that was used
for the recording. However, it is noteworthy that GGIR has in-built
functionality to automatically read data from the following brands and
format:

-   [GENEActiv](https://activinsights.com/) .bin files
-   [Axivity](https://axivity.com/) AX3 and AX6 .cwa
-   [ActiGraph](https://theactigraph.com) .csv and .gt3x (.gt3x only the
    newer format generated with firmware versions above 2.5.0. Serial
    numbers that start with "NEO" or "MRA" and have firmware version of
    2.5.0 or earlier use an older format of the .gt3x file). Note for
    Actigraph users: If you want to work with .csv exports via the
    commercial ActiLife software then note that you have the option to
    export data with timestamps. Please do not do this as this causes
    memory issues for GGIR. To cope with the absence of timestamps GGIR
    will calculate timestamps from the sample frequency, the start time
    and start date as presented in the file header.
-   [Movisens](https://www.movisens.com/en/) with data stored in
    folders.

So, what if you are using any other device or your data come in a
different format? GGIR might still be able to help you. Any other
accelerometer brand that generates csv output can also be read by GGIR,
see documentation for functions `read.myacc.csv` and argument
`rmc.noise` in the [GGIR function documentation
(pdf)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR/GGIR.pdf).

Note that functionality for the following file formats was part of GGIR
but has been deprecated as it required a significant maintenance effort
without a clear use case or community support: (1) .bin for the GENEA
monitor by Unilever Discover, an accelerometer that was used for some
studies between 2007 and 2012) .bin, and (2) .wav files as can be
exported by the Axivity Ltd OMGUI software. Please contact us if you
think these data formats should be facilitated by GGIR again and if you
are interested in supporting their ongoing maintenance.

## Setting up your work environment

### Prepare folder structure

1.  **The data directory:** This is referred to as `datadir` within
    GGIR. All accelerometer data that needs to be analysed should be
    stored in one folder, or subfolders of that folder. It is important
    that the data directory does only contain accelerometer raw data
    files, as any other file would trigger error when trying to run GGIR
    over this folder (and subfolders). Note that GGIR will use the name
    of the data directory to give a name to the folder that will store
    the output data, therefore you might want to give this folder an
    appropriate name, preferable with a reference to the study or
    project it is related to rather than just 'data'.
2.  **The output directory:** This is referred to as `outputdir` within
    GGIR. This should be an existing directory in your maching in which
    GGIR will store all the output that it generates. The output
    directory cannot be a subdirectory of the data directory, as this
    would be problematic for GGIR.

### Run GGIR for first time

Now that you have organized your data as explained above, you are able
to run GGIR for first time. Use the following command to run GGIR over
your data using all the default options.

```{R,eval=FALSE}
library(GGIR)
GGIR(datadir="C:/mystudy/mydata",
 outputdir="D:/myresults")
```

And now, after some minutes, you should be able to see how your output
directory gets files, reports, and visualizations in it. You are now
ready to have fun with GGIR!

### Other files

Prepare any other additional file/s that you might want to use to guide
GGIR with the data processing. Generally, GGIR will take csv files as
input, so this is the format for your sleep logs, activity logs, or
other files should. This digital book contains instructions for the use
of these files.
