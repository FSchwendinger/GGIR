In this vignette, you will learn how to install GGIR and get ready for its use.
Recommended folder structure.

## Installation

#### Get R and RStudio

1.  [Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

2.  [Download and install
    RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

#### Install GGIR

Install GGIR with its dependencies from CRAN. You can do this with one
command from the console command line:

``` r
install.packages("GGIR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, to install the latest development version with the latest
bug fixes use instead:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wadpac/GGIR")
```

### Other packages you may need

Additionally, in some use-cases you will need to install one or multiple
additional packages:

-   If you are working with Axivity, GENEActiv, or GENEA files, install
    the GGIRread package with `install.packages("GGIRread")`
-   If you are working with ActiGraph gt3x files, install the read.gt3x
    package with `install.packages("read.gt3x")`
-   If you want to derive Neishabouricounts (with
    `do.neishabouricounts = TRUE`), install the actilifecounts package
    with `install.packages("actilifecounts")`
-   If you want to derive circadian rhythm indicators using the [Cosinor
    analysis and Extended Cosinor
    analysis](with%20%60cosinor%20=%20TRUE%60), install the ActCR
    package with `install.packages("ActCR")`
