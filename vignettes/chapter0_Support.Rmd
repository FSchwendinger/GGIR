GGIR is open-source software, and it does not come with service or
support guarantees. However, as a user-community, you can collaborate
and support each other through the [GGIR google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/RpackageGGIR) or the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues). Please
use these public platforms rather than private e-mails such that other
users can learn from the conversations.

Moreover, we provide online [training
options](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-training/) for using GGIR, along
with the flexibility of single-support sessions and [dedicated support]
tailored to your specific needs.

## Training options for GGIR

Check our dedicated training
[website](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-training/) with more details
and the option to book your training. Do you have questions about the
training or the booking process? Do not hesitate to contact us via:
[training\@accelting.com](mailto:training@accelting.com){.email}.

#### GGIR standard training

The [GGIR standard
training](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-standard-training/) aims to
train you in both the hands-on use and understanding of GGIR's key
functionalities and algorithms for common use-cases. This is a 3-session
x 2-hour training offered twice a year. We provide a detailed
description of the pipeline that GGIR proposes for the analysis of
accelerometer data. You can expect to learn about the origin and vision
behind GGIR, how to configure it to your research needs, and the
step-by-step functioning of the main algorithms used by GGIR to provide
physical activity and sleep-related output.

#### R essentials for GGIR

The [R essentials for
GGIR](https://www.accelting.com/r-essentials-for-ggir/) is designed to
train you in the basic R skills that you will need for using GGIR. If
you have no or limited experience with R then this course is for you.
This eminently hands-on practice training will show you how to install
R, RStudio, and GGIR, together with the commands that you will be using
when interacting with GGIR. This is a 2-session x 2-hour training that
is always offered the week before the GGIR standard training to help you
out to get the most of the experience.

Also of interest may be the brief [free R introduction
tutorial](https://www.accelting.com/updates/short-r-tutorial/).

#### Private training in GGIR

Are you already involved in a (or various) research project(s)? Do you
need a full training in GGIR with the flexibility to tailor the course
to your specific interests and needs? Then check out our [private
training in
GGIR](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-private-training-info/)! Here, we
can teach you how to use GGIR in line with the GGIR standard training,
but focus strongly on the aspects relevant to you. This is a 3-session x
2-hour training in which you and your lab colleagues are welcome to join
the sessions. This training may include (but it is not limited to)
discussions on the analysis plan for your dataset, revision or
assistance to develop your R scripts, or explanations of specific GGIR
algorithms that you might be using.

#### Extra GGIR support session

In the case that you already have used GGIR and feel like you do not
need a full training on it, but still you could benefit from some help,
then consider the extra [GGIR support
session](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-training/#:~:text=GGIR%20private%20training%22/%3E-,Extra%20GGIR%20support%20session,-Aim%3A%20Single%20session).
This is a single 90-minute session in which we will discuss your use of
GGIR, answer specific questions, or address the challenges you may run
into. This service is usually intended for those who have already
participated in the standard or private GGIR training and feel the need
for an additional session.

## Dedicated support

If you need dedicated support with the use of GGIR, need someone to
adapt GGIR to your needs, or would like a new functionality to be
included in GGIR, then do not hesitate to contact us. [Vincent van
Hees](https://www.accelting.com/) and [Jairo H
Migueles](https://www.jhmigueles.com/) are available as independent
consultants.
