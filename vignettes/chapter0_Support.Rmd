GGIR is open source software and does not come with service or support
guarantees. However, as user-community you can help each other via the
[GGIR google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/RpackageGGIR) 
or the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues). Please
use these public platform rather than private e-mails such that other
users can learn from the conversations. Additionally, we offer a variety of 
training options on the use of GGIR, as well as single-support sessions and 
dedicated support to your specific needs. More details below.

## Training in R essentials and GGIR

We offer frequent online GGIR training courses. Check our dedicated training
[website](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-training/) with more details and
the option to book your training. Do you have questions about the
training or the booking process? Do not hesitate to contact us via:
[training\@accelting.com](mailto:training@accelting.com){.email}.

Also of interest may be the brief [free R introduction tutorial](https://www.accelting.com/updates/short-r-tutorial/).

## Dedicated support

If you need dedicated support with the use of GGIR or need someone to
adapt GGIR to your needs then Vincent van Hees is available as
[independent consultant](https://www.accelting.com/).
