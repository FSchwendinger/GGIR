GGIR is open-source software, and you can contribute to its development in 
various ways! Read this article for more information.

# Contributing, Support, and Keeping up to date

**How to contribute to the code?**

The development version of GGIR can be found on
[github](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR), which is also where you will
find
[guidance](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
on how to contribute.

**How can I get service and support?**

GGIR is open source software and does not come with service or support
guarantees. However, as user-community you can help each other via the
[GGIR google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/RpackageGGIR) or the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues). Please
use these public platform rather than private e-mails such that other
users can learn from the conversations.

If you need dedicated support with the use of GGIR or need someone to
adapt GGIR to your needs then Vincent van Hees is available as
[independent consultant](https://www.accelting.com/).

**Training in R essentials and GGIR** We offer frequent online GGIR training courses. Check our dedicated training
[website](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-training/) with more details and
the option to book your training. Do you have questions about the
training or the booking process? Do not hesitate to contact us via:
[training\@accelting.com](mailto:training@accelting.com){.email}.

Also of interest may be the brief [free R introduction tutorial](https://www.accelting.com/updates/short-r-tutorial/).

# Setting up your work environment

## Install R and RStudio

[Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

[Download and install
RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

Install GGIR with its dependencies from CRAN. You can do this with one
command from the console command line:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("GGIR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, to install the latest development version with the latest
bug fixes use instead:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wadpac/GGIR")
```

Additionally, in some use-cases you will need to install one or multiple 
additional packages:

-   If you are working with Axivity, GENEActiv, or GENEA files, install
    the GGIRread package with `install.packages("GGIRread")`
-   If you are working with ActiGraph gt3x files, install
    the read.gt3x package with `install.packages("read.gt3x")`
-   If you want to derive Neishabouricounts (with `do.neishabouricounts = TRUE`),
    install the actilifecounts package with `install.packages("actilifecounts")`
-   If you want to derive circadian rhythm indicators using the [Cosinor analysis and Extended Cosinor analysis] 
    (with `cosinor = TRUE`), install the ActCR package with `install.packages("ActCR")`
