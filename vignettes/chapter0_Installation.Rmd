GGIR, as an open-source R package, requires an initial step of
installing R on your system. Additionally, for a more user-friendly and
interactive experience with R, it is recommended to use RStudio, which
stands as the most widely utilized integrated development environment
(IDE) for R.

## Install R and RStudio

We strongly recommend ensuring that both R and RStudio are up-to-date,
ideally with the latest versions available. It is advisable to install
versions no older than one year to guarantee compatibility with the
latest packages and enhancements. That said, GGIR works with any R
version â‰¥ 3.5.

-   [Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

-   [Download and install
    RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

## Install GGIR

Install the latest released version of GGIR with its dependencies from
CRAN. You can do this with one command from the console command line:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("GGIR", dependencies = TRUE)
library(GGIR)
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version, which
might include additional bug fixes and functionalities. To get the
development version, please use:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wadpac/GGIR")
library(GGIR)
```

## Other packages you may need

Additionally, in some use-cases you will need to install one or multiple
additional packages. Note these packages are not installed by default,
so please follow the instructions if:

-   You are working with Axivity or GENEActiv files, install the
    GGIRread package with `install.packages("GGIRread")`
-   You are working with ActiGraph gt3x files, install the read.gt3x
    package with `install.packages("read.gt3x")`
-   You want to derive Neishabouricounts (with
    `do.neishabouricounts = TRUE`), install the actilifecounts package
    with `install.packages("actilifecounts")`
-   You want to derive circadian rhythm indicators using the [Cosinor
    analysis and Extended Cosinor analysis] (with `cosinor = TRUE`),
    install the ActCR package with `install.packages("ActCR")`
