# Install GGIR

## From CRAN

Install GGIR with its dependencies from CRAN. You can do this with one
command from the console command line:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("GGIR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## From CRAN: development version

Alternatively, to install the latest development version with the latest
bug fixes use instead:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wadpac/GGIR")
```

## Other packages you may need

Additionally, in some use-cases you will need to install one or multiple 
additional packages:

-   If you are working with Axivity, GENEActiv, or GENEA files, install
    the GGIRread package with `install.packages("GGIRread")`
-   If you are working with ActiGraph gt3x files, install
    the read.gt3x package with `install.packages("read.gt3x")`
-   If you want to derive Neishabouricounts (with `do.neishabouricounts = TRUE`),
    install the actilifecounts package with `install.packages("actilifecounts")`
-   If you want to derive circadian rhythm indicators using the [Cosinor analysis and Extended Cosinor analysis] 
    (with `cosinor = TRUE`), install the ActCR package with `install.packages("ActCR")`
