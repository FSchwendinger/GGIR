[**GGIR**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR) is a widely used
R-package designed for the processing of multi-day **raw accelerometer
data**, specifically tailored for applications in physical activity,
sleep, and circadian rhythm research.

The term ***raw*** refers to data being expressed in m/s<sup>2</sup> or
gravitational acceleration, as opposed to the previous generation
accelerometers which stored data in brand-specific units aggregated per
time interval, referred to as epochs, and typically lasting between 1
and 60 seconds. In contrast, raw data accelerometry typically collects
that with 10 to 100 values per second. GGIR can handle a variety of file
formats from various sensor brands.
